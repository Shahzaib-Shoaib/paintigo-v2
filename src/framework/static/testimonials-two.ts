    text: "These pens were put to the test with bible school crafts, being used by lots of kids from k-12 grade. The the pens were very user friendly, the flow was perfect as well as the pigment. We were painting on rocks the colors were vivid and true. The fine point worked great in small areas in the project. Would defiantly purchase again!",

I’ve written little words and pictures on our computer, I’ve written on my kids notebooks for church and their little busy bags for church. Plastic, notebook covers and fabric, they worked well for all of those. Paper is a no go!",

    text: "I’ve been using paint pens for a long long time. Painting rocks is a hobby of mine and when friends come over we often find ourselves doing just that. I’ve never had such a thin lined marker to be able to do detail work! I often make RIP rocks for friends pets who pass the rainbow bridge. These pens make it easy to make a lovely keepsake! Love the vibrant colors.",

    text: "I love these! I would definitely purchase again! They are bright, almost neon, and hold impressively thick paint while having a thin tip. I have had the white turn different colors sometimes, depending on what I’m drawing over, but I can go over it again once it dries. And sometimes, it’s white the first time. Overall, I am very satisfied!",

    text: "I am in LOVE with these paint markers. They were easy to use and very pigmented so the colors were bright and fun! The only negative is that for the first couple of uses the pen tip is a little jagged so it wouldn’t be a smooth use. But after a few uses they were worn it and I didn’t have any problems!",

    text: "My hobby is painting Kindness Rocks and have tried several kinds of pens to use to write on the rocks with limited success. So far, these pens are the best I've found. They produce smooth lines and don't splatter. The colors are vibrant and after sealing the rocks with a spry, they have maintained their color. I am very impressed with them.",

They go on the product smoothly and have good color saturation. Other paint pens that I’ve used tend to be too watery. Absolutely would recommend.",

I highly recommend these paint pens. They work wonderfully well for my 14 year old artist! Great paint pens for an extremely resonable price! Definitely will be getting these again!! ❤❤",

The points do fine line work wonderfully, but have good coverage for larger areas as well. I haven’t tested how long they stay yet, I’m hoping for hand washing they won’t fade too quickly.",

They do work better on smooth surfaces but also used on a wood plaque and it looks nice. I also painted on some seashells. I would recommend.",
